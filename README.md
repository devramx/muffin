# muffin
Test drive project to evaluate cors logic as provided by 'cors' package from npm. Using Expressjs + nodejs. Also contains client-side apis for demo. Very primitive not suitable for any concrete solution.

## Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devramx/muffin.git
cd muffin
npm install
node server/app.js
```
`` Server listens to port 3001 ``

To start the client, just open client/index.html in any browser.
